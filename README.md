# Gestalt
RESTful configuration manager

#What is this?!
This is a service-based configuration manager, tracking closely with DNX 5.0. It's based on autofac, and nearly everything is or will be configurable.

#How does it work :O
Pass a json document to one of the RESTalicious methods, and it will perform the associated magic

#How can I test it?!?!?! @_@
Clone the repo, stand up a mongo database (only provides a repository for mongo now, this will change over time, and mongo will be abstracted away entirely into its own project). Look at the swagger api, and have fun.
